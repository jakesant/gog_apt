# CNN Notebook Section
In this section we used a number of techniques and experimented with a number of CNN architectures before we settled on the ones implemented.
The 4 notebooks included are:
* DCNN = UCI Dynamic CNN
* SCNN = UCI Static CNN
* ODDCNN = Our Data Dynamic CNN
* ODSCNN = Oyr Data Static CNN

In the folders *Our Dataset* and *UCI Dataset* you will find the respective datasets.

In Helper.py you will find some visualization functions.

Please run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` before using these notebooks.
